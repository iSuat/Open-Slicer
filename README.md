**OpenSlicer Studio** is a modern, zero-install, browser-based (Single-File HTML) open-source reimagining and extension of Autodesk® *Slicer for Fusion 360* (formerly *123D Make*). It converts 3D models (`.STL`, `.OBJ`, `.3MF`) into fabrication-ready 2D cutting plans (`.DXF`, `.SVG`, `.EPS`) for laser cutters, CNC routers, and cardboard/wood physical model making.

It combines modern 3D scene workflows inspired by OrcaSlicer / Bambu Studio (*3D Convex Hull Lay-on-Face*, *Outside-Object Protractor Gimbal*) with an advanced geometric slicing and interlocking joint engine inside a single independent file.

## 🚀 Key Features

### 1. Three Fabrication Techniques (Construction Techniques)
* **Stacked Slices (`SS`):**
  * Slices the 3D model with parallel horizontal planes based on user-defined material thickness and layer skipping.
  * **Parametric True Hollow:** Computes exact parallel interior offsets across every layer using `ClipperLib.ClipperOffset`, automatically protecting top and bottom solid caps.
  * **Intelligent Dual-Plane Dowel System:** Interactive draggable dowels between upper and lower planes. Automatically caps the top layer as a blind-hole cap, supports multi-island solid blocks, and calculates a full Dowel Cut Summary list.
* **Interlocked Slices (`IS` - Waffle Grid):**
  * Slices the model along orthogonal `X` and `Y` axes, cutting half-lap (*halving joint*) interlocking slots at every `(X_i, Y_j)` rib intersection.
  * **Physical Assembly Hierarchy:** `Y` ribs (`Y-1..Y-m`) act as the base foundation lattice on the table with top-down slots; `X` ribs (`X-1..X-n`) slide down from above (`+Z`) with bottom-up slots.
  * **Slot Destination Guide Labels:** Engraves corresponding target rib IDs (`Y-3`, `X-2`) at the bottom of each slot to guide assembly.
  * **CNC Corner Relief & Chamfer:** Applies **T-Bone** or **Dog Bone** corner reliefs based on tool bit diameter and **Notch Factor** lead-in vector chamfers at slot entries.
  * **Linear Rib Sliding:** Selected `X` or `Y` ribs can be slid along their axis directly in 3D or via a slider, bounded to prevent jumping over adjacent neighbors, and reset individually.
* **Radial Slices (`RS` - Polar Slicing):**
  * Slices the model around its vertical central axis with angled radial fins (`R-1..R-n`) and horizontal circular rings (`Z-1..Z-m`).
  * **Angle-Invariant Halving Joints:** Outer radial slots for horizontal rings and inner horizontal slots for vertical fins.
  * **Full CNC Corner Relief & Chamfers:** Dog-Bone, T-Bone, and vector lead-in chamfers work seamlessly on radial geometries.
  * **Radial Inward Slide Animation:** Assembly steps animate vertical fins sliding radially inward along $(\cos\theta_i, \sin\theta_i, 0)$.

### 2. CAD Integration & Universal Live File Watcher
* **Universal Live File Watcher (Browser):**
  * Powered by the File System Access API (`window.showOpenFilePicker`), watch any STL or OBJ exported by any CAD software (Autodesk Fusion 360, Blender, Rhino, SolidWorks, FreeCAD).
  * The file on disk is polled every ~850ms. When re-exported or saved in your CAD software, the 3D model reloads instantly in OpenSlicer Studio without resetting camera orientation, position, slicing technique, or manufacturing parameters.
* **Autodesk Fusion 360 Add-In (`OpenSlicerBridge`):**
  * A lightweight personal add-in script for Fusion 360.
  * Exports the active design to your chosen target folder with 1-click or save hotkey using dynamic `[Project]-[Body].stl` naming.

---

### 3. Large-Scale CNC (5m–10m+) & Robust 3D Scene
* **Dynamic Grid & Camera Scaling:** When large architectural or furniture scale models (5000–10000mm+) are loaded, floor grid spacing (50/100/200/500mm), camera `near`/`far` planes, and ground dimension lines scale proportionally, preventing scene clipping and distortion.
* **Zero Z-Fighting:** Materials utilize `polygonOffset` to prevent depth flickering between solid geometry and wireframe outlines.
* **Flicker-Free Autodesk ViewCube:** 6 faces, 12 chamfer edges, and 8 corners use disjoint geometric boundaries, eliminating rotation artifacts.
* **Damped Navigation Zoom:** Magnifier tool zoom speed is tuned (`0.18`) for smooth, controlled inspections.
* **Bidirectional Cut Layout Visibility:** Parts excluded in the 2D Cut Layout immediately restore in the 3D scene when unhidden.

---

### 4. OrcaSlicer & Autodesk Slicer Hybrid 3D Viewport Tools
* **OrcaSlicer 3D Convex Hull "Lay on Face" (`F`):** Computes the 3D convex hull (*QuickHull / Shrink-Wrap*) of the model, merges coplanar facets into candidate stability patches, and snaps the clicked face flush to $Z = 0$ with an exact 5-step matrix alignment.
* **Static Tick Protractor Gimbal:** Both **Slice Direction** and the toolbar **Rotate (`R`)** tool share a consistent interaction:
  * A white 5°/15° protractor ring remains fixed while dragging the directional arrow handle.
  * Cursor **inside** the circle snaps cleanly to **5° increments**; cursor **outside** provides smooth **0.1° free rotation**.
* **Independent Transform Reset (`↺`):** Each transform tool (`Move`, `Rotate`, `Scale`) features an individual reset button without affecting the others.
* **Raw Model Inspection Eye (`👁️`):** Clicking the eye icon hides slice extrusions to display the original imported solid geometry as an opaque mesh (`ghostMesh`), allowing rapid surface topology checks.

---

### 5. 2D Cut Layout, Fullscreen Lightbox & Multi-Layer Export
* **2D Sheet Nesting:** Automatically arranges parts across stock sheets according to sheet dimensions, margins, and tool diameter. Supports multi-selection (`Ctrl+Click`, `Shift+Click`) and part exclusion.
* **Fullscreen Sheet Lightbox:** Double-clicking any sheet card in the 2D panel opens a full-viewport canvas with cursor-centered zoom, click-drag panning, and keyboard sheet navigation (`◀` / `▶`).
* **Multi-Layer `.DXF`, `.SVG`, `.EPS`, and `.ZIP` Export:**
  * Outputs color-coded layers tailored for laser cutters and CNC CAM software (AutoCAD, Vectric Aspire, Fusion 360, LightBurn):
    * `OUTER_CUT` (Red - ACI 1): Outer contours and interlocking slot cuts
    * `INNER_CUT` (Yellow - ACI 2): Interior holes and hollows
    * `DOWEL_HOLES` (Green - ACI 3): Alignment pin/dowel holes
    * `LABELS_PART` (Cyan - ACI 4): Part numbering (`Z-1`, `X-1`, `Y-1`, `R-1`)
    * `GUIDES` (Blue - ACI 5): Stack alignment guide outlines
    * `LABELS_SLOT` (Magenta - ACI 6): Interlocking slot destination guide IDs (`Y-3`, `X-2`)
    * `SHEET_BORDER` (White - ACI 7): Sheet boundary outline
  * 100% compliant with **AutoCAD R12 (`AC1009` `POLYLINE` + `VERTEX` + `SEQEND`)** specification for universal CAM compatibility.
